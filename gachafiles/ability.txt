1037.Genderswap,1.8
#Allows you to swap your gender and the genders of those who don't or can't resist your ability. The swapped gender version will usually be in a form that you yourself find attractive. You could also go halfway if need be.
1038.Deception,3.1
#Your words are imbued with the power of lies, making them sound more convincing or believable. The stronger a target is, the more energy will be consumed and the less efficient the ability will be. The more unbelievable your lie is, the less effective the ability is and the more energy it will consume.
1039.Vainglory,6.4
#You possess the ability of Vainglory, the ability to assert your own false truth. By expending your energy, you are able to convince people of your words, no matter how far-fetched, such as making them believe they were a bird. The larger the power difference between you and the target dictates the efficiency of the ability, the harder a lie to believe, the more energy you have to expend to assert it.
1040.Golemancy,5.8
#Golemancy allows you to animate the inanimate into golems under your control. You can create a golem out of any inanimate object you have access to. The power of the golem is dependent on the quality of the materials used and your own power level. Creating golems out of stronger materials consumes more energy, and the maximum amount of golems you can maintain under your control is dependent on your maximum energy(minimum 10); the stronger a golem, the more slots they take up.
1041.Elemental Sublimation,5.2
#Allows the user to turn their body into any basic element of their choosing while still retaining control over their body.

1043.Luck Drain,5.2
#Allows you to touch people to drain their luck and add it to your own temporarily. The more energy you expend and the longer the contact the more luck you can steal, the more luck you steal, the more the energy requirement scales exponentially. This luck is temporary and will fade over time, returning to the target it was stolen from.
1044.Jinx,3.0
#Jinx allows you to inflict a curse on targets that reduces their luck by touch, not to an extent that would harm them, but enough to disadvantage them. This effect can be somewhat increased by expending more energy and being stronger than the target. You can also unleash this ability as a moderate speed Hex projectile.
1045.Misfortune,4.8
#You can unleash an aura of misfortune from your body, reducing the luck of those close to you or direct it towards further targets by narrowing the range. The more energy you expend, the more powerful the luck reduction is, and the difference between you and the target's power dictates the effect of the aura on them.
1046.Malus,6.2
#"Directing the hatred of fate" You are able to inflict a target in your range of vision with Malus. When a target is marked by Malus, you are able to expend energy to reduce the outcomes of their actions. If this were DnD, you would be putting a negative modifier on the actions they take. The stronger of a malus you inflict on a target, the more energy you have to expend and the more exhausted you will be. Trying to put too big of a malus on too strong of a target can cause it to backfire.
1047.Choosing Fate,8.5
#You are able to see numerous possible futures that do not take into account your precognition. And you are able to enforce the future of your choice by expending energy. Out of the billions of possible futures from a slot machine, you can always pick the one where you get a jackpot. Or for your opponents, throw out the attacks and perform the actions that give you a better advantage. The more powerful a target and the more improbably a future you are altering the fate of, the larger the backlash you will incur and the more energy you have to expend. With enough energy you can even enforce an absolutely improbable future where your opponents attack tunnel effects through you.
1048.United We Stand,4.6
#Yugioh - For as long as United We Stand is active, you are able to select a familiar and add all of its physical stats onto your own. For each ability slot you are not using, you can choose another familiar to use the strength of.

1062.Minor Cure,2.4
#You are capable of healing others by expending your energy. You can heal things like stabs, slashes and broken bones, but more severe wounds take significantly more energy. Healing effectiveness is dependent on the power difference between you and the target.
1063.Cure,3.5
#You are capable of healing others and yourself by expending your energy. The scale of healing you perform is dependent on the amount of energy you expend; the more lethal a wound is, the greater amount of energy you need to expend. Healing effectiveness is dependent on the power difference between you and the target.
1064.Greater Cure Wounds,4.4
#You are capable of greatly healing others and yourself by expending your energy. The more energy you expend, the stronger a healing effect you can exert; the more severe a wound, the more energy your healing consumes, but you can heal even lethal wounds. Healing effectiveness is dependent on the power difference between you and the target.
1065.Restoration,5.7
#You are capable of healing yourself and others by expending your own energy and imbuing them with potent healing energies. The more energy you exert, the more potent the effect of your healing. Healing effectiveness is dependent on the power difference between you and the target.
1066.Nightmare,5.6
#"Reaper of Minds" You have offensive mind manipulation, you cannot subtly influence minds, if conventional telepathy is a scalpel, yours is a missile. You can send mind blasts to confuse opponents, damage their minds with a look, crush the minds of those weaker than you, and hijack their bodies to act against their minds or torment them with living nightmares. The less destructive purposes Nightmare is used for, the greater the energy cost is increased by. Effectiveness is dependent on the mental strength of the opponent and their power level relative to yours.
1067.Cry,0.1
#You are able to shed very salty tears at will.
1068.Super Polymerization,5.6
#Yugioh - Allows you to temporarily fuse two living beings together to get a new entity with both of their abilities. Unwilling targets can resist the effect depending on their level of power. The stronger targets you fuse together with yourself or between them, the higher the energy cost. Keeping two entities fused together drains energy over time.
1069.Greedy Healing,5.5
#"Restoration, but at what cost?" Greedy Healing is an incredibly potent restoration ability, but instead of consuming Mana, it consumes wealth instead. The more wealth you give up to Greedy healing, the more potent the effect you will get. For a dollar, you would be pressed to recover a chipped nail, but with enough material wealth burnt, you can bring back even limbs and possibly even a life. The stronger a target you are affecting, and the larger the effect you want to enact, the more wealth you have to sacrifice in the form of wealth that belongs to you, such as gold coins, artefacts, items and or even people.(Infinite Money Glitch does not count as a valid sacrifice)
