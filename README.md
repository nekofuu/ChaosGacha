# Chaos Gacha

Welcome to your very own slice of the infinite chaos of the multiverse.

## Over a Thousand Entries

- Around 80,000 words of pure handwritten descriptions
- Over 1,900 Unique Entries
- Freely adjustable odds
- Customizable Gacha Entries
- And much more!

## Usage

You can start rolling immediately by using the website located [here](https://www.chaosgacha.com/). You can download the latest packaged version of the desktop app [here](https://github.com/Bronzdeck/ChaosGacha/releases/latest), though you should beware that that the gacha list may not be up to date.

Alternatively, for those of you that are a little more tech-savvy, you can download this repository and run ```build.bat``` to automatically generate an executable. This script requires [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

Feel free to use it however you like. Add your own entries, make your own list from scratch, or just use the interface as-is. You are free to use it on your own works and project, though it would be appreciate if you linked the Chaos Gacha when you use it and maybe mention me (BronzDeck) as the creator. You could also just link one of my profiles on either Ao3, Questionable Questing, or Webnovel.
