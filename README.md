# Chaos Gacha

Welcome to your very own slice of the infinite chaos of the multiverse.

## Over a Thousand Entries

The current iteration of the Chaos Gacha features:

- Around 80,000 words of pure handwritten descriptions
- Over 1,900 Unique Entries
- Freely adjustable odds
- Customizable Gacha Entries
- And much more!

## Usage

Feel free to use it however you like. Add your own entries, make your own list from scratch, or just use the interface as-is. You are free to use it on your own works and project, though it would be appreciate if you linked the Chaos Gacha when you use it and maybe mention me (BronzDeck) as the creator. You could also just link one of my profiles on either Ao3, Questionable Questing, or Webnovel.
